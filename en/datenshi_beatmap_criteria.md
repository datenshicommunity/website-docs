#### Notes
Before requesting, make sure your unranked map you are submitting are :

- In Graveyard, at least 1 month to avoid the map getting updated by the mapper (abandoned map)
- Metadata that soothe the eyes. For example **Diao Ye Zong feat.** is bad, please avoid it.

#### Rules

1. The map must be playable and still follow Bancho's Ranking Criteria. If not, it is likely to be loved.
2. Longstream maps that are easy to abuse is more likely to be loved. (Because the majority of relax players can use the DT mod to get PP)
3. Overlapped objects, 2B maps, Storyboard based maps (Maps that require the storyboard to be turned on to be played) will be loved.
4. Near impossible maps (Galaxy Collapse, etc.) that players can pass will be ranked.
5. A marathon map with a duration of more than 40 minutes (or those that hit the std score limit) will be loved. (Example: Songs Compilation by Nevo with 54 minutes)
6. Abusive PP Maps (Maps that contain only 1-2 patterns, stacking longstream high bpm (relax)) are likely to be loved.

All maps are likely to be ranked unless there are features mentioned in the rules above.

#### RANKED

1. PLAYABLE, This one is a must, what it meant by playable is that it can atleast be played by a casual players (Players with average abilities and doesn't pursue skills / basically they play just to have fun)
2. Less unecessary overstream note where the notes accumulate on a single stream, This will be manually checked.
3. Unique & Variative patterns, Not too monotonous but this is optional, we can still reconsider it.
4. METADATA like OD AR HP will be judged accordingly.

#### LOVED

1. Unique Patterns is a big plus.
2. Playable Monotone and interesting patterns (Nothing wrong with being motonous, atleast the pattern is interesting and will be pleasant to play)
3. METADATA Is not gonna be a problem here as long as it doesn't interfere with gameplay.
4. puritit. (*Single*-chunked note that can cause Auto-death will be thrown here)

#### NOTE

- Can be judged with the rules (SR will be weighted too)
- Denying any unplayable maps unless someone can pass it (Categorized as **LOVED**)
- Training map pack will be categorized as LOVED, same rule apply with osu!mania.
- Because the CTB RC is a little more flexible than the official one, charts with a Length under 5 minutes even though there are only less than 2 difficulties which are rankable, will be able to be approved if it follows the written rules above.
- Old pattern (ex. Deif maps under 2014) can be reconsidered to be ranked too.

#### RULES

1. Pattern must be playable.
2. If *the devs* breaks the map intention of being playable, it'll be considered as:
  - **GOVERNMENT KNOWS**
  - Helvetica Standard
3. Pattern fits the mapset proportion. This determines a map(set) being ranked/loved/unranked.
4. For maps in general, patterns will be limited following these rules:
  a. Finishers only allowed as part of stream ending or finisher only streams.
    Example: `ddddK`/`DDKDKD` is acceptable.
    - Finisher only stream have lower leniency to get accepted based on the map difficulty in general.
  b. Finishers **strongly recommended to have different color from preceding note** to end a stream.
    - `ddddK`: Acceptable.
    - `dkkdD`: Strongly Against.
  c. Finishers should have a proper rest time both before and after of it, for Easier difficulties.
  
  Note: This simply to note that Cynply mapping style is generally unacceptable.
5. For *gimmick maps*, as long as it's delivered properly, it's accepted.

PS: Metadata checks is pretty strict in here.
