#### RANKED

 1. PLAYABLE this one is a must, what mean playable is that it can be at least played by a casual player (player with average skill that not really care about PP)
 2. Less Unecessary Overstream note, as said it will take some times to check this criteria (possibly will be ranked)
 3. Unique & Variative patterns not too monotone but still can have a chance to be ranked
 4. METADATA like OD AR HP can be consideration material

#### LOVED

 1. Unique Patterns is a big plus
 2. Playable Monotone and interesting patterns
 3. METADATA not really take point here as long as it not interfere the gameplay

#### NOTE

#### RULES

1. Playable, and it a must, if not playable it will be going to loved
2. Less 1/4+1/6 and  1/6+1/8 pattern, take that as consideration before submitting a request if you want it to be ranked, but it still can be loved
3. Longstream is fine, but stable, yea if stable 1/4 atau 1/6 longstream maybe no problem, but 1/4+1/6 still be approved if the pattern 1/6 position is on the end of the stream, for 1/6 in the middle of the stream and continued by 1/4 stream might be going to loved
4. Endurance map, if the map has longstream without any break time dan more than 2 minutes length and/or stamina map with high bpm might also goes to loved, for stamina map but the bpm is under 250 still can be considerated
5. Mapset with Difficulty SpeedRate, Mapset with many Diff Rate prefered going to loved
6. Doublet spam, definetly loved
7. Pattern with random slider appear or Pattern inside the slider, this also goint to loved, sometimes the pattern on the slider can't be clicked
8. Spinner Spamming, if this is too much can decrease gauge significantly, of course going to loved
9. Invisible Pattern, this kind of pattern usualy needs storyboard,  and it's Aspire tipe maps, of course Loved
10. Metadata, this one  is also consideration material for ranking purpose

#### OVERALL

1. **Vibro = NO**
2. Pattern playable, what it mean to be playable is the pattern can be played by a player and is fit the Official RC. 
3. Map Pack (Endurance, Dan) = Loved, as said on the title, training pack is a bunch of maps that made for training purpose and not for casual playing
4. For 7K beatmaps that has SR>5 minimum HP 7 and OD 7.

Notes: good or not the map is subjective, i'm here as a mapper still can't yet find maps with good patterns, so please understand. Playable pattern is also the same, even a map with SR 7 can be considered playable for some player, and not for the others. except VIBRO

#### LN MAPS

1. For the rate up/speed up won't be ranked because the pattern is just the same. 
2. For maps that has SR >9 will be pending or Loved. there's different case for 7K. For 7k, for now SR>15 will be Pending or Loved
3. Untuk map LN 7K yang memiliki SR>6 minimum HP 6.5 dan OD 0

Notes: FOR this LN rules might change anytime
